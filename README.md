### TinyLink Introduction
TinyLink is a holistic system for rapid development of IoT applications. It adopts a top-down approach, which greatly accelerates the developing process. Taking the application code as input, TinyLink automatically generates hardware configurations as well as the hardware dependent code executable on the targeted hardware platform. TinyLink provides a kind of fool development process which makes IoT development eaiser and faster.
